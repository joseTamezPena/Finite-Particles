# Finite Particles

This repository contains the functions associated with a model of particle-particle interaction.

The basic assumption is that there are finite-sized particles responsible of absorbing and emitting vector corpuscles. Each corpuscle has position $\mathbf{x_c}$, orientation, $\mathbf{o_c}$, and velocity, $\mathbf{v_c}$.The velocities of the corpuscles follows the Galilean relativity:

$$
\mathbf{v_c}=\mathbf{v_p}+\mathbf{c};
$$

where $\mathbf{v_p}$ is the finite particle velocity vector and $\mathbf{c}$ is a vector traveling a the speed of light $c$

There are two basic finite-particles:

-   The positive, $\mathbf{p^+}$, continuously emits $q$ corpuscles per second whose orientations parallel to the corpuscle velocity. i.e., 

$$\mathbf{o_c} \cdot \mathbf{c} = c$$

-   The negative, $\mathbf{p^-}$, continuously emits $q$ corpuscles per second whose orientation is anti-parallel to the corpuscle velocity. i.e.,

$$\mathbf{o_c} \cdot \mathbf{c} = -c$$

It is assumed that the universe if filled with corpuscles that are continuously absorbed by the finite-sized particles. The absorption process will create an action that will change the particle velocity proportional to the corpuscular density, velocity and orientation.

$\mathbf{p^+}$, action is in direction of the absorbed corpuscle orientation, while

$\mathbf{p^-}$, action is in opposite direction to the absorbed corpuscle orientation.

## The Electrostatic Force

The net force between two particles:

$$
f = (k q_1 q_2)/(4 π r^2)(|c + v_1|/c) ((c \cdot (c + v_1 - v_2))/|c + v_1 - v_2|))^2
$$

For electric charges. k is the Coulomb constant, $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the elementary charges of the electron, i.e., e, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the velocities of the interacting particles, and $r$ is the distance between the two particles.

## The Mass

The inertia (mass) of finite-sized particles is proportional to the
